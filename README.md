### Tasks
- Calculate and visualize total sales, profit, orders, and profit margin.
- Compare year-over-year sales and profit performance by product, month, and sales channel.
- Analyze sales by customer and highlight top-performing locations.
- Create dynamic, interactive dashboards with slicers for user-friendly filtering by Date, City, Product, and Channel.

### Key Features
- **Total Sales Calculation:** A complete sales overview for the selected period.
- **Profit and Profit Margin Analysis:** Financial performance visualizations.
- **Year-Over-Year Comparisons:** Insights into product performance and monthly trends.
- **Top 5 Cities Analysis**: Highlights most lucrative locations for focused marketing.
- **Customer Sales Analysis:** Detailed customer-level insights.
- **Dynamic Slicers:** Filters for personalized data interaction.

## Steps Followed to Create Power BI Sales Dashboard
1. **Gather Data**: Kaggle sample data used for dashboard creation.
2. **Power Query – Data Extract, Transform & Load**: Power Query Editor in Power BI was used for data cleaning and transformation making it suitable for analysis. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, verifying data types, merging datasets, and creating calculated columns.
3. **Create a Date Table**: To work with Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) time intelligence functions, there’s a prerequisite model requirement - To have at least one [Date Table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/model-date-tables).
4. **Create Data Model**: Designed a data model to represent relationships between tables, define keys, and establish hierarchies for accurate analysis and visualization.
5. **Develop Reports**: Built interactive reports with visualizations (charts, tables, maps) in Power BI Desktop. Implemented slicers for Date, City, Product, and Channel, with drill-through capabilities.
